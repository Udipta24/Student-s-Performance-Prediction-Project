# Student-s-Performance-Prediction-Project
This is a simple project I have worked upon while I was exploring Logistic regression, a popular and easy to understand classifier model. Initially, I have used the Linear Regression model provided by Scikit-learn, but I am looking forward to implement the algorithm from scratch to get  a better understanding of the algorithm.
